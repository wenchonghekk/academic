summary: Present the paper "Uncertainty Quantification of Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Data:Challenges and Opportunities"
abstract: 'With the advancement of GPS, remote sensing, and computational simulations, large amounts of geospatial and spatiotemporal data are being collected at an increasing speed. Such emerging spatiotemporal big data assets, together with the recent progress of deep learning technologies, provide unique opportunities to transform society. However, it is widely recognized that deep learning sometimes makes unexpected and incorrect predictions with unwarranted confidence, causing severe consequences in high-stake decision-making applications (e.g., disaster management, medical diagnosis, autonomous driving). Uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to estimate a deep learning model confidence. This paper provides a brief overview of UQ of deep learning for spatiotemporal data, including its unique challenges and existing methods. We particularly focus on the importance of uncertainty sources. We also identify several future research directions related to spatiotemporal data.'
